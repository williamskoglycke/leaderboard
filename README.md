# G-Loot code test for backend developers

## Things you will need
* Git
* Java 13
* A code editor

## General info
* Written using [spring boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* Uses [h2](http://www.h2database.com) as database
* Uses [lombok](https://projectlombok.org) which needs to be enabled/configured in your editor
* Database migrations done with [flyway](https://flywaydb.org)
* Tests done in [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
* Maven wrapper is included for building/testing
  * On Unix systems use:

  * On Windows:
  `./mvnw.cmd clean verify`

## Test
This is a sample spring boot which currently only offers a single GET endpoint at `/api/v1/leaderboard`
which will return a leaderboard consisting of entities representing players and their score.

We expect you to perform the following list of tasks:
* Extend functionality
    * Add support for multiple leaderboards
    * Add new API endpoints for:
        * For fetching the position of a user for a specific leaderboard
        * Setting score for a user in a leaderboard
    * Write tests for the code you add
* Refactor the method in LeaderboardService
